2. Spear Phishing: A more targeted version of phishing that often involves impersonating someone the victim knows.
3. Vishing: Voice phishing â€“ attackers call you pretending to be from a legitimate company to gather sensitive information.
4. Pretexting: The attacker pretends to be someone else (such as a co-worker or IT support) to gain access to private information.
