# Types of Social Engineering Attacks

## 1. Phishing

Phishing is one of the most common forms of social engineering. Attackers use fake emails, websites, or messages that look legitimate to deceive victims into revealing sensitive information like login credentials, personal information, and payment details.

*How to recognize Phishing:*
- Unsolicited emails or messages.
- Suspicious links or attachments.
- Urgent requests for personal information.

## 2. Spear Phishing

Spear phishing is a targeted form of phishing where attackers customize their attacks, often impersonating someone the victim knows. This is a more convincing attack as it leverages specific details about the victim or their company.

## 3. Vishing

Vishing is voice phishing where attackers use phone calls to impersonate someone trustworthy, such as a bank representative or a company IT support staff, to gather sensitive information.

## 4. Pretexting

In pretexting, the attacker creates a fabricated story or pretext to obtain personal information. The attacker may impersonate a trusted colleague or service provider and request sensitive data under false pretenses.

## 5. Baiting

Baiting involves offering something enticing (like free software or prizes) in exchange for sensitive information, such as login credentials or account numbers.
