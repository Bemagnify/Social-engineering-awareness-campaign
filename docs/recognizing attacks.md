# Recognizing Social Engineering Attacks

Social engineering relies on human error, which is why itâ€™s essential to recognize the signs of an attack. Here are some common red flags:

1. *Unsolicited Requests*: If you receive an unexpected message asking for sensitive information, be cautious.
2. *Urgency*: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to pressure you into acting quickly without thinking.
3. *Suspicious Links*: Hover your mouse over any link to see the actual URL. Be wary of misspelled or altered domain names.
4. *Personal Information Requests*: Be cautious when asked for sensitive personal details, especially over email or phone.

### How to Protect Yourself:
- Always verify the source of emails or phone calls.
- Do not provide personal information to unsolicited requests.
- Use multi-factor authentication for critical accounts.
